This is the method I used running the YOLO object detection algorithm on MacOS.
This method was done with the help of the https://github.com/llSourcell/YOLO_Object_Detection github repo.
Also used the link - https://keponk.wordpress.com/2017/12/07/siraj-darkflow/ which was the key to getting it to work.

You will need Anaconda installed on your machine, which will aid in the process of getting it setup and also being a powerful tool for python and machine learning users.

Step 1: Clone the repo - https://github.com/thtrieu/darkflow

Step 2: Creating a conda virtual enviroment for the project 
        
        conda create -n NAME python=3.6

Step 3: Accessing the new enviroment

        source activate NAME

Step 4: Installing dependencies 

        conda install tensorflow cython numpy

Step 5: Add the repo with the magic opencv version
        
        conda config --add channels conda-forge

Step 6: Installing the opencv library

        conda install opencv

Step 7: Build the Library

        python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace

Step 8: You will need to donwload the YOLOv2 608x608 weights file here (https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolov2/)

Step 9: Create a bin folder in the darkflow-master and put the weights in it.

        mkdir bin #while being in the darkflow folder
        
Step 10: Get a video which you would like to render and process with the YOLOv2 object detection method and put it in the darkflow folder

Step 11: Use the following to start the process.

         python flow --model cfg/yolo.cfg --load bin/yolov2.weights --demo videofile.mp4 --saveVideo
         
Step 12: This was the Result.
